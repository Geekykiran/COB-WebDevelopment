# Project Repository: Phase 1 and Phase 2

Welcome to the project repository for Phase 1 and Phase 2! This repository contains three distinct projects, each focusing on different aspects of web development. Below, you'll find a brief overview of each project:

## Phase 1 Projects

### Project 1: Responsive Registration/SignUp Form

This project involves creating a responsive Registration/SignUp form using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The form includes various fields such as first name, last name, Date of Birth, Phone Number, Username, Email, password, address, gender, and more. Users can fill in their information, and there is a register button to complete the sign-up process.

### Project 2: Responsive To-Do List

The second project in Phase 1 is a responsive To-Do List created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This To-Do List not only displays the current date but also allows users to add tasks to the list. It provides editing and deleting functionality for managing the list of tasks as they are completed.

## Phase 2 Project

### Project 1: Unit Converter

In Phase 2, we have a responsive unit converter project. This project combines HTML for structure, CSS for styling and responsiveness, and JavaScript for the conversion functionality. Users can select different units, input values, and click a calculate button to get the converted result. There's also a reset button to clear previous calculations and return to default settings. The unit converter uses conversion formulas to provide accurate results.

## How to Use These Projects

Each project is contained in its respective directory within this repository. You can navigate to the individual project directories to find the source code and assets.
